VARCall workflow
================

A driving script called 'VARCall' invokes 'BAMmaker', 'VCFmaker_SNP', 'VCFmaker_INDEL', and 'SNP-INDEL_merge', successively.  The script 'BAMmaker' allows trimming of single- and paired-end reads with Trimmomatic, read alignment against a reference genome with BWA, read sorting with Samtools, and potentially duplication removal and realignment around InDels with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), successively.  Following an approved framework for variant discovery, the scripts ‘VCFmaker_SNP’ and ‘VCFmaker_INDEL’ call and filter variants (i.e. SNPs and InDels) according to GATK best practices in order to retain high-confidence variants. 

Quick Start
===========

## run it on Linux/Mac OS X system

Simply run the command in the 'src/' directory:

	 ./VARCall

You must to set scripts in your $PATH variable:

	export PATH=$PATH:src/


Dependencies
============

VARCall needs python 2.7 (tested with 2.7.6), and the following librarires are require:

* [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Download)

VARCall requires the following programs in your $PATH:

* [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
* [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)
* [picard-tools](http://picard.sourceforge.net/)
* [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)
* [GATK](www.broadinstitute.org)
* [SnpSift](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/)

Ouputs
======

The workflow 'VARCall' produces a VCF file, matrices of pairwise distances ('VCFtoMATRIX'), a report about breadth and depth coverages ('reportMaker'), as wells as files of concatenated variants and pseudogenomes in order to be able to build fast or slow phylogenetic inferences, respectively. The pseudogenomes correspond to the reference genome where the genotypes of detected variants are replaced in each genome of the dataset.
