iVARCall2 workflow
==================

This workflow called iVARCall2 for "independant variant calling 2" aims to perform the variant calling analysis from Illumina paired-end reads based on the GATK HaplotypeCaller algorithm. Each sample are processing independently and a g.vcf file is produce for each of them. This allow to combin several iVARCall2 results if the same reference genome is used. 

The differents workflow steps and scripts are presented below :

- A driving script called 'iVARCall2' invokes 'BAMmaker', 'iVCFmaker', 'iVCFmerge', 'iVCFilter', 'VCFtoMATRIX', 'VCFtoFASTA', VCFtoPseudoGenome' and 'iReportMaker2' successively. 

- The script 'BAMmaker' allows trimming of paired-end reads with Trimmomatic, read alignment against a reference genome with BWA, read sorting with Samtools, and potentially duplication removal and realignment around InDels with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), successively.  

- Following an approved framework for variant discovery, the scripts 'iVCFmaker' call and filter variants (i.e. SNPs and InDels) according to GATK best practices in order to retain high-confidence variants and make a g.vcf file for each sample.

- The script 'iVCFmerge' merge all g.vcf in a single vcf file.

- All variants detected are filered by 'VCFilter' in order to remove variants caused by missing data or due to reference.

- The script 'VCFtoMATRIX' make 3 distance matrix (SNPs, InDels and SNPs + InDels) from all variants selected by the workflow.

- All filered variants are concatenante in a 3 fasta files (SNPs, InDels and SNPs + InDels) by the 'VCFtoFASTA' script. This fasta files can be used to produce a phylogenetic tree.

- The 'VCFtoPseudoGenome' script replace for each sample all SNPs in the reference genome in order to obtain a 'PseudoGenome'. For this step, InDels are not included.

- Finaly, the script "iReportMaker2" produce a pdf file where several variant calling informations and parameters are listed. 

Each script can also be invoked independently.
