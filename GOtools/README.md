GoXML and EveryGO
=================

 'GetGOxML' aims to centralize the functional annotations of variants (i.e. genotype, effect of homoplasy, NP numbers, gene IDs, gene names, type, position, phenotypical impact) with the GO-terms information in a unique XML file.

Based on the accession numbers contained in the XML file, the driving script 'GetGOxML' invokes the scripts 'GOSlimmer_XML' and 'GOxML' in order to associate the identified variants with their respective and relevant GO-terms reachable in the [QuickGO browser](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) 

- 'GOSlimer_XML' generates prokaryote-specific subset of GO terms (go_prok.txt) from a Gene Ontology graph (i.e. [go-basic.obo](http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology)  file)  in order to remove Eukaryote GO-terms from the dataset.

- 'GOxML' associates NCBI accession identifiers contained in the XML file with their respective relevant GO-terms

In order to centralize the functional annotations of variants (i.e. genotype, effect of homoplasy, NP numbers, gene IDs, gene names, type, position, phenotypical impact) and the GO-terms, the script 'GOxML' integrates also the curated GO-terms (i.e. prokaryote GO-terms) and related biological processes to the common xml file.

Using the number of compared leafs and the XML file, the driving script 'EveryGO' selects non-synonymous variants (SNPs and InDels), and distinguishes between GO-terms from the interest variants (i.e. tested sample) and all variants (i.e. universe) which is used for the hypergeometric test, then invokes 'GOWalker' and 'GOView', successively.

The script 'GOWalker' counts the GO-terms from the sample (i.e. variants from compared leafs) and the universe (i.e. all variants) for each GO-term, as well as the sample (i.e. total GO-terms in the sample) and universe sizes (i.e. total GO-terms in the universe) in order to perform a GO-term enrichment analysis based on the hypergeometric test and the implemented Bonferroni correction.

Using results of hypergeometric tests related to specific compared leafs, the script 'GOView' aims to compute a graphical representation of the GO-term enrichment analysis.


Quick Start
===========

## run it on Linux/Mac OS X system

Simply run the command in the 'src/' directory:

	 ./GoXML
	 ./EveryGO

We recommend to set scripts in your $PATH variable:

	export PATH=$PATH:src/
	export PATH=$PATH:src/otherScripts/


Dependencies
============

GoXML and EveryGO need python 2.7 (tested with 2.7.6), and the following R librarires are require:

* [GGplot2]
* [gridExtra]
* [biocLite.R]


Parameters
===================

##  GoXML parameters

 * '-i': XML path (REQUIRED)
 * '-obo': go-basic.obo path (REQUIRED)
 * '-o': output prefix (REQUIRED)
 * '-d': NP-EBI_databases.tsv path 
 * '-g': EBI-GO_databases.tsv path
 * '--withHomoplasy': keep homoplasy variants

##  EveryGO parameters

 * '-xml': XML input file obtained from the GoXML including all variants (REQUIRED)
 * '-xmlcomp': XML input file obtained from the GoXML including variants of interest (REQUIRED)
 * '-comp': one or several values refering to XML comparison ids (ascending order, REQUIRED)
 * '-rpath': Rscripts folder path' (REQUIRED) 
 * '--mkuniverse': build universe
 * '--view': generate graphical representation

Ouputs
======

The script GoXML produces an XML file included GO-terms and the script EveryGO produces a TSV file including results of hypergeometric tests.
